[National Alliance for Medical Imaging Computing](http://www.na-mic.org/)

The National Alliance for Medical Imaging Computing (NA-MIC) is a multi-institutional, interdisciplinary team of computer scientists, software engineers, and medical investigators who develop computational tools for the analysis and visualization of medical image data. The purpose of the center is to provide the infrastructure and environment for the development of computational algorithms and open source technologies, and then oversee the training and dissemination of these tools to the medical research community.

[The NA-MIC Training Wiki](http://wiki.na-mic.org/Wiki/index.php/Slicer:Workshops:User_Training_101)

This site set of linked Web pages to guide users through the download of the Slicer software package. This site also provides many additional tutorials on how to analyze medical imaging data beyond those used in HST.583.

On MRI Physics, many of your course faculty recommend the following site. Students have found it helps to understand the class by covering the basics well without too much information on any given topic:
