  "course_description": "This team-taught multidisciplinary course provides information relevant to the conduct and interpretation of human brain mapping studies. It begins with in-depth coverage of the physics of image formation, mechanisms of image contrast, and the physiological basis for image signals. Parenchymal and cerebrovascular neuroanatomy and application of sophisticated structural analysis algorithms for segmentation and registration of functional data are discussed. Additional topics include: fMRI experimental design including block design, event related and exploratory data analysis methods, and building and applying statistical models for fMRI data; and human subject issues including informed consent, institutional review board requirements and safety in the high field environment.\n\n##### {{< anchor \"fellows\" >}}{{< /anchor >}}Additional Faculty\n\nDiv Bolar\n\nDr. Bradford Dickerson\n\nDr. John Gabrieli\n\nDr. Doug Greve\n\nDr. Karl Helmer\n\nDr. Dara Manoach\n\nDr. Jason Mitchell\n\nDr. Christopher Moore\n\nDr. Vitaly Napadow\n\nDr. Jon Polimeni\n\nDr. Sonia Pujol\n\nDr. Bruce Rosen\n\nDr. Mert Sabuncu\n\nDr. David Salat\n\nDr. Robert Savoy\n\nDr. David Somers\n\nDr. A.
